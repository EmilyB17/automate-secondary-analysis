# Automating access to SRA for secondary analysis

### Welcome!

In this workshop we will complete the following learning objectives:
1. Access NCBI's SRA through the command line and download metagenomics data
2. Examine our downloaded data and perform basic quality control
3. Learn to optimize these scripts for batch submission to PSU's high-powered computing clusters

### Acknowledgements

This workshop was made possible by Dr. Jasna Kovac, the fall 2021 workshop coordinator, and by Dr. Justin Petucci of ICDS RISE program. These scripts are adapted from Dr. Istvan Albert's *[Biostar Handbook](https://www.biostarhandbook.com/)*. This is a great resource that I highly recommend!

# Getting Started

**Step 1: Find an accession number on NCBI's Sequence Read Archive**. 

Today, we will use data from a 2018 *Nature Medicine* paper, [Gut microbiota and FXR mediate the clinical benefits of metformin](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0222-4). Navigate to the online version of this paper and search for the accession code to their shotgun metagenomics data. (You should see the accession number: PRJNA486795)

Copy the accession number into the search bar for NCBI's [Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). If the data was uploaded correctly (which from personal experience, is easier said than done!) a webpage will appear that looks like this: 

I like to use the **Run Selector** webpage. Spend a few minutes poking around; what kind of information is available on this page?
